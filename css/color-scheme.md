# Color Scheme

[Can I Use color-scheme?](https://caniuse.com/?search=color-scheme)

The `color-scheme` CSS property allows an element to indicate which color schemes it can comfortably be rendered in.

When a user selects one of these color schemes, the operating system makes adjustments to the user interface. This includes form controls, scrollbars, and the used values of CSS system colors.

Example:

```css
color-scheme: dark;
/*
  color-scheme: normal;
  color-scheme: light;
  color-scheme: dark;
  color-scheme: light dark;

Global values
  color-scheme: inherit;
  color-scheme: initial;
  color-scheme: revert;
  color-scheme: revert-layer;
  color-scheme: unset;
*/
```
