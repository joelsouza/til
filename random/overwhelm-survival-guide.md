# Overwhelm: The Survival Guide

This was cut'n'pasted from here [zenhabits.net/overwhelm-survival](https://zenhabits.net/overwhelm-survival/)

### View Tasks as an Opportunity to Practice Focus and to be Present. An opportunity to serve and add value? An opportunity to play and be curious? A place to find joy and transcendent experience?

- Notice when you’re feeling overwhelmed or wanting to procrastinate.
- Choose a new view of the tasks.
- Practice this as often as you can, so that slowly you start to shift your relationship to the tasks, and your default view of the tasks.
- If you feel overwhelm again, no problem — just remind yourself of your new view and practice this way.

If you relate to your tasks as **an opportunity for play, joy and adventure**, what a fun day you’ll have! If you relate to them as a way to serve, with **_love and focus_**, what a beautiful day that would be.
