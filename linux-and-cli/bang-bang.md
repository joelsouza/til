# !!

If you type `!!` in bash, it will replace the `!!` with whatever the last command you ran. So if you just type !! and enter, it'll run the last command you ran. If you run sudo !! it'll re-run the same command again but with sudo in front (we'll talk about sudo soon.)

Usage example:

```bash
sudo !!
# example using "sudo !!" to run last command as root
```
