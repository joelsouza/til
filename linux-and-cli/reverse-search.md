# Reverse Search

I've always used zsh and zsh-autocompletion and never missed a command I ran forever ago. We can do a reserve search in a regular shell without zsh, just using `control+R`

Let's say I ran the command echo "hello my friends" last week, and I wanted to find that command again and I only remember that it had something to do with "friends". So I'd type `CTRL+R` and start typing "friends". If it was the most recent command that I had run with "friends" in it, it'd show up, and I could hit enter, and it'd run. If there was another command between now and again, I can hit `CTRL+R` again to look further back in the history. This is also super useful and something I do a lot.
